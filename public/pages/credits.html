          Aka is the lead force behind Whiskers as the only developer; Initially
          skeptical about the project's potential, Aka dove deep into coding,
          and she made Whiskers, with the help of her friends, what it is today

          Sploogles, the artist being Whiskers emoji's, and is the backbone of
          Whiskers. His support for Aka has been nothing short of monumental,
          ensuring that Whiskers didn't just survive but thrived. Without
          Sploogles, Whiskers might have remained a mere idea or, worse, a buggy
          mess like its predecessor, Cat Chat. Instead, thanks to Sploogles,
          Whiskers is a polished gem, full of personality and fun
